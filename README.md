# Christmas Movie Advent Calendar

*Built with Python and Streamlit, including optional NLP analysis*

---

This is a small interactive app that picks a random Christmas film every day of December leading up to Christmas. 
The film is chosen from a dataset of Christmas movies, and once selected it cannot be picked again.  

The project also includes some small data science components such as:

- Sentiment analysis for film descriptions (NLTK)
- Pandas for database analysis
- Streamlit for UI interactivity
